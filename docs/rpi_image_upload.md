## Remote desktop installation

Attention! Master PC (laptop) must be in the same subnet as raspberry (_192.168.100.x_), for example, _192.168.100.2_. 
Download VNC viewer by the link below:

:open_file_folder: [VNC Viewer](https://1drv.ms/u/s!Am_hkdn5bouSg3VY2tIxuGJWQBJh)

Run it on your laptop or PC and create new connection (_File->New connection_):

- VNC Server: _192.168.100.10_ 
- Name: _192.168.100.10_
- Press "OK"  
- If dialog box "Identity Check. Duplicate VNC Server identity" is appeared, ignore it by pressing "Continue"  
- If dialog box "Unencrypted connection" is appeared, ignore it, setting check "Donâ€™t warn me about this again on this computer" and press "Continue"  
- Press in the popup window: Username=pi, Password=raspberry  
- Set check "Remember password" and press "OK"  

## Expanding image size to the SD-card full capacity
Image size is approximately 5Gb, but the SD card has a bigger size (up to 32Gb). To allow OS use all SD-card capacity it is required to expand file system size. To implement this open console and enter the command:  

``` bash
sudo raspi-config
```

Implement the next steps:    
- open "Expand Filesystem" in the menu, then press "OK"
- select "Finish" (by pressing twice "tab" key) and then press "enter"
- "Would you like to reboot now?" - press "OK"
