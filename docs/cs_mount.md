# How to mount the control system

Use our [video tutorials](video_tutorials) to mount a control system.

If you have installed SketchUp you can explore QUEEN control system [sketchup model](https://1drv.ms/u/s!Am_hkdn5bouS1G9334yBP5ogC4-f) with it.  

## Recommended additional purchase list

After you receive a [queen pack](queen_pack), we recommend to purchase the following stuff:

| item                          |                      photo                      | pcs  | comments, requirements, models                                                              |
|-------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------:|------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| sheet of plywood or textolite |   ![](assets/photo/plywood-1.jpg ':size=200')   | 1    | use a piece of plywood or textolite at least 630mm x 750mm to mount the queen pack items    |
| electric box                  | ![](assets/photo/electrobox-1.jpg ':size=200')  | 1    | you can optionally purchase electric box to hide the plywood or textolite, but not required |
| tapping screws                |    ![](assets/photo/screw_1.jpg ':size=50')     | much | depends on what kind of surface was chosen: plywood or textolite                            |
| multimeter                    | ![](assets/photo/multimeter_1.jpg ':size=100')  | 1    | use multimeter later to check the connections after the mount process                       |

## QUEEN Pack components locating

First place all the components on the plywood

## Check the connections

Use multimeter to check the connections before you power on the control system. Also it is recommended to check 24V, 12V and 5V voltages after the power on, to be sure power supply is operable.
